<h1>Trivia</h1>
<p>A quiz game with challenges that will make your nights with friends more fun.</p>

<h2>🚀 Objective</h2>
<p>Develop a trivia game based on the Trivia game, using React and Redux. As a group project, develop the functionalities according to pre-defined demands on a Kanban board. It was essential for the group to be organized using the board for greater efficiency and minimizing code conflicts.</p><br>
<p>Working in a group is not an easy task, as the same problem can be solved in several ways. I was able to learn how to develop an application with different people from whom I learned a lot. It was also very challenging to work with the questions and answers received, indicating which ones are correct and which are the wrong alternatives. Setting a time limit for each question and calculating the score based on response time was one of the best projects I have ever worked on.</p>
